<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.waymo.com/">Waymo</a>. Prior to joining Waymo, I was a Senior Applied Scientist at <a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126/">Amazon
Lab126</a>, a Visiting Researcher at <a href="https://cvit.iiit.ac.in">CVIT</a>, and before that I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/willow">Willow group</a>.</p>

<p>I spent four beautiful years doing my PhD right below the French
Alpes, at <a href="https://team.inria.fr/perception/">INRIA Rhône Alpes</a>. Before that, I got my
Bachelors in Computer Science (with honours) and MS in Computer Vision from
<a href="https://iiit.ac.in">IIIT-Hyderabad</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, I have had the opportunity to work with amazing people like <a href="https://team.inria.fr/steep/people/peter-sturm/">Peter Sturm</a>, 
<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/">Ivan Laptev</a>, <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/">Josef Sivic</a>, 
<a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/">CV Jawahar</a>, <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/">PJ Narayanan</a> and several others.</p>
<p>While not working, or discussing AI with friends, I spend my time hiking, biking, running along
<a href="https://www.santacruz.org/listings/west-cliff-drive/">west cliff drive</a> and occasionally
dabbling in sports like cricket, ping pong and tennis.</p>
