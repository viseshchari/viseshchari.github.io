<p>I spent four beautiful years doing my PhD right below the French
Alpes, at INRIA Rhône Alpes (<a href="https://team.inria.fr/perception/">https://team.inria.fr/perception/</a>).</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I have had the opportunity to work with amazing people like Peter Sturm
(<a href="https://team.inria.fr/steep/people/peter-sturm/">https://team.inria.fr/steep/people/peter-sturm/</a>), Ivan Laptev (<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/">https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/</a>),
Josef Sivic (<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/">https://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/</a>), CV Jawahar (<a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/">https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/</a>),
PJ Narayanan (<a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/">https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/</a>) and several others.</p>
<p>While not working, or discussing AI with friends, I spend my time hiking, biking, running along
west cliff drive (<a href="https://www.santacruz.org/listings/west-cliff-drive/">https://www.santacruz.org/listings/west-cliff-drive/</a>) and occasionally
dabbling in sports like cricket, ping pong and tennis.</p>
